      <description>Display search results  The HSPAs respond with on_search API to send back the HPID of the doctors who match the search criteria of EUA. The EUA looks up the Health Professionals Registry (HPR) to fetch the details of the doctor against the HPIDs received from the HSPA. The other details such as the quote and availability are fetched by the EUA from the HSPA directly by firing the search API again to the HSPA with the specific doctorâ€™s HPID.</description>

      <description>Share Health Records The shared health records functionality allows the patient to share health records linked to their ABHA address with the doctor. The reference EUA at present, provides a non-native experience to the patient, where, upon confirmation of appointment, health record sharing request is auto-triggered by the HSPA. The patient can choose any PHR application to share their health records with the doctor.
The functionality will be updated to provide a native experience to the user and the documentation will be updated accordingly.</description>

      <guid>http://kiranma72.github.io/abdm-docs/uhi/building-uhi-eua/teleconsults/get-final-prescription/index.html</guid>
      <description>Get final prescription The prescription sent by the doctor to the patient gets linked to their ABHA address. The user needs to be notified to check the PHR app to approve addition of the prescription to their health records.
Note: Current reference EUA provides a non-native (patient moves out of the EUA) experience to the patient for addition of health records. This documentation will be updated as the functionality moves to a native experience for the user.</description>
