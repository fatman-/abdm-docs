Upon receipt of such a request from Gateway, CM acknowledges and sends back a consent request ID to the HIU via the gateway. The CM then notifies the patient that an HIU has made a consent request. The patient can view the request details and choose to either grant consent or deny it. Subsequently, the CM notifies the HIU requester of the patient’s consent or denial status via the gateway. If the request is granted, the CM sends across the Ids of the consent artefacts that were created against the request, to the HIU.

If there is any difference in this information, the health record cannot be retrieved correctly. ABDM will forward the Discovery request from the PHR Application to the participating Health Facility. The Discovery request consists of the ABHA Address (chosen by the user), Name, DoB, Gender and Mobile Number. The Health facility will search for any health records for this combination. If it finds a record it will respond with the available records listed in the form of care contexts.

The address looks like “username@hie-cm”. Currently ABDM manages 2 HIE-CMs. The Sandbox HIE-CM @sbx and the production HIE-CM @abdm. PHR Apps use APIs provided by the HIE-CM to create a new ABHA address for users.\nThe user chosen ABHA address has to be alphanumeric. The only numeric address allowed is 14 digits and that must be a valid ABHA number.\nRecommended User Experience User is requested to enter their mobile no / email id The mobile / email is validated via an OTP All ABHA Addresses linked to the mobile / email is retrieved and presented to user. User can select an already created ABHA address and login OR User can create a new ABHA address linked to this mobile or email PHR app should check \u0026 suggest PHR addressess that are available when creating a new address This is demonstrated in the ABHA PHR reference app\nMultiple ABHA Addresses for same user Users are allowed to create multiple ABHA addresses as per their convienence / requirement. ABDM requires PHR apps to educate users that is it better to maintain only one ABHA address and link all health records to this address.\nThe ABDM HIE-CM restricts the number of ABHA addresses that can be linked to a single mobile number to 4\nAPI Sequence for Registration using Health ID number.

The Unified Health Interface (UHI) is a network where applications built on the UHI open protocol can interoperably connect with each other to provide health services. UHI is a key Digital Public Infrastructure that enables discoverability and transaction for digital health services. UHI works with other ABDM building blocks like HIE-CM for interoperable exchange of personal health data and registries like HPR \u0026 HFR to enable trust from participating doctors and health facilities. UHI takes an ‘Open Network’ approach to build the gateway and to enable the creation of a nationwide, decentralized, open, and inclusive network.\nABDM manages the UHI Gateway and the UHI Registry. Any application that wishes to participate in UHI must\nImplement the UHI protocol Register with the UHI registry Use the UHI Gateway to discover other UHI apps \u0026 their services Comply with the UHI Market Rules Share metrics with UHI for reporting, greviance redressal and dispute resolution It will be provide a system to facilitate the discovery of services between user facing applications and health service provider applications. Open access across diverse health service providers and patients can drastically expand demand-supply ecosystems and transform the digital healthcare landscape in India.\nWhat is UHI Open Protocol? UHI Open Protocol is a Decentralized Health Protocols aimed to define the interoperable protocol specifications for creating a decentralized network of health services. The purpose of APIs is to enable interoperability between Healthcare providers (doctors, paramedical, health facilities, etc.) and Healthcare consumers. The UHI Open Protocol architecture and APIs allow individuals/ organizations to set up an open network of consumer side applications and health service provider side platforms using common protocol specifications. It renders open APIs, schemas and example flows for the different use cases in healthcare.\nThe protocol is being developed as an open community initiative on GitHub https://github.com/dhp-project/DHP-Specs\nUHI Services The services on UHI will include, but not be limited to\nTeleconsultation Booking Physical Appointments Lab Bookings Ambulance Services Blood Donation UHI Participants Any service transaction in UHI involves five entities:\nUser: Patients seeking digital health services through UHI.\nEnd User Application (EUA): User-facing applications offering digital health services\nUHI Gateway: Layer routing the initial requests and responses involved in UHI transactions between HSPAs and EUAs\nHealth Service Provider Application (HSPA): Provider-facing applications allowing doctors to respond to EUA requests and fulfill digital health services\nHealth Service Provider (HSP): Providers of healthcare services\nRole of the UHI Gateway The role of the gateway in a UHI service transaction is limited to the search and discoverability of health services. For example, if a user searches for teleconsultation services on an EUA, the gateway routes the request to all available HSPAs and sends back the responses to the EUA. The booking, payment and fulfillment of the service, thereafter, is done directly between the EUA and the HSPA.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"UHI Protocol","uri":"/abdm-docs/8-uhi/about_uhi/index.html"},{"content":"Collect \u0026 Save PHR Address from the user This section covers the methods that must be supported for collecting the PHR Address from the user\nBy Scanning HIP QR code during registration By scanning the User’s PHR Address QR code during registration By sharing the PHR address verbally during registration Using the discovery method from a PHR app ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Collect \u0026 Save PHR Address","uri":"/abdm-docs/7-sharing-health-records/save-phr-address/index.html"},{"content":"Creation of ABHA Number ABHA number is a 14 digit number that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC.

The information provided in the above section is meant only for guidance. Usually in EMR/EHR/PMS systems at hospitals, the systems index and patient records are filtered by patient-id and potentially grouped by any of the above means.\nIn terms of hierarchy, consider the following to understand how patients’ records may be grouped in HIP systems:\nEncounter or visit: This records the details of activity (one or more) directly relating to the patient. It is not advised to send specific clinical-encounters (single clinical-patient interaction) as care-context, unless you are sure that such recordings are going to be very limited. Episode of care: This grouping means can link a series of encounters together in case of problems. Program: This grouping can link a series of care episodes or visits. For example: IMNCI (Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness) as seen in various MCTS programs in Indian context Vertical program specific like India’s TB elimination program - Nikshay National Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) program National Health Mission (NHM) Specific program targeted for Health and Wellness Centers It is quite possible that a HIP system may not be capable of doing such grouping. In such cases only, consider using the same care-context reference that’s assigned to patient reference in the HIP system.\nThe idea is to provide an aggregate or grouped means of patient’s care settings at various healthcare centers. If proper care context grouping is not provided, patients who visit healthcare centers for different treatments will be forced to discover and link their care settings for each therapy or service.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Understand Care Context","uri":"/abdm-docs/3-milestone2/understand-care-context/index.html"},{"content":"By Demographics Applicable To HMIS / LMIS (PVT) Government Health App Scan User ABHA QR/Demographics Mandatory Mandatory Functionality Overview ABDM requires HMIS/LMIS to generate a link token that can be used for linking of health records.

There are 3 major steps that a doctor needs to complete before providing any service through UHI\nSet up Calendar/availability The doctor can chose to set their available timings on set days. There are two options that can be made available to the doctor\nFixed - The time interval is fixed. Flexi - The doctor provides the number of patients they wish to allocate in a hour. Each patient gets a token. Provide their fees/charges: The doctor can chose to charge different fees for different services they wish to provide.\nUI Reference API Sequence A teleconsultation starts with a /search which is broadcasted to all the registered HSPAs through the gateway. The next set of API calls happen directly with the HSPA and EUA. These include /init and /confirm APIs to which the HSPA responds via /on_init and /on_confirm.\nResponding to a search request Example JSONs The following JSONs represent the Search API that are fired from the EUA for each of the above criteria. If the user provides multiple criteria, the resultant JSON will be a consolidation of the individual parameters used. The search query is broadcast to all relevant HSPAs by the Gateway and the corresponding on_search callback responses are sent back to the EUA from the Gateway. The on_search response from the HSPA will contain the catalog of doctors who meet the search criteria. The URL, Method and Headers are the same for all:\nURL : {to be added}\nMethod: POST\nHeaders: Authorisation\na.

Teleconsultation","uri":"/abdm-docs/8-uhi/building-uhi-hspa/setup-for-teleconsultation/index.html"},{"content":" Read this section to understand how various building blocks of ABDM works and where your application fits in the ecosystem\nABDM uses a federated architecture to help users collect their health records across various healthcare providers, view their records from any PHR application and share their records with any requestor with their consent\nThe image below shows the various entities/roles involved in the PHR framework\nWhat is a Health Information Provider (HIP)? Any entity that agrees to share digital health records with their users using the ABDM APIs is called an HIP (Health Information Provider). HIPs can be hospitals, labs, health care centers, government health programs, teleconsultation players, clinics or pharmacies - basically any entity which creates medical data pertaining to a patient.\nHIPs are required to maintain a digital copy of both the inpatient and outpatient records for each person in their care. In order to become an HIP, health facilities must enrol in the ABDM health facility registry and adhere to the HIP HIU Guidelines\nWhat is a Health Repository Provider (HRP)? Health repository providers are software service providers who offer ABDM compliant software to health facilities like hospitals, diagnostic centers etc. An instance of an ABDM certified software is a HRP. The HRP enables healthcare providers to become HIPs or HIUs and meet their obligations of sharing and securely maintaining health records of patients digitally. HRPs offer long term storage of health records on behalf of a HIP. For example, a hosted lab information management system provider (LIMS) may update their software to become a ABDM compatible Health Repository Provider. Any lab using this hosted LIMS software can rapidly become a HIP by adopting the software. The organizations that make ABDM certified software are referred to as Digital Solution Companies (DSCs) by NHA.\nThe ABDM sandbox hosts a reference HRP – You can play with it at https://emrsbx.abdm.gov.in\nWhat is an HIU? An HIU (Health Information User) is an entity that wants access to digital health information about a user. An HIU can be a hospital, clinic, healthcare technology company, organizations working on health analytics, insurers, medical researchers, government entities etc. HIUs will be able to request for health records of a user, and upon obtaining the user’s digital consent, access a copy of the patients records and use them for the time period consented by the user.\nWhat is a HIE-CM? HIE-CM stands for Healthcare Information Exchange and Consent Manager. This is the key ABDM building block that enables creating ABHA addresses, managing consents related to user’s personal health data and supports exchange of interoperable health data across HIPs and HIUs.\nThe ABDM architecture is designed to support multiple HIE-CMs to operate in the network. Each HIE-CM is referred to by a domain. NHA operates 2 HIE-CMs currently. A Sandbox HIE-CM with the domain @sbx and a production HIE-CM with the domain @abdm.\nWhat is an ABHA address? In order to manage their personal health records, users must first create an account on a HIE-CM – called their Ayushman Bharath Health Account (ABHA) address. This looks like sandeep321@abdm. The @abdm tells us which HIE-CM is responsibile for this address.\nThe term ABHA address is also referred to as PHR address across the documentation\nHospitals \u0026 Labs are expected to link records with their patients ABHA Address. Creating an ABHA Address is super simple – You can start with just Name, Year of birth, Gender along with a Mobile number. ABHA address can be linked to a strongly validated \u0026 unique ABHA Number\nABDM is designed to work for people with smartphones, features phones and even those without phones. Users with smartphones can be encourgaed to get their ABHA address via a PHR app. They can create a easy to remember ABHA address that is alphanumeric like sandeep321@abdm. Users with only feature phones or without phones will require assitance in creating an ABHA address. It is recommended that they create an ABHA number (preferably with Aadhaar). Every ABHA number also automatically acts as a ABHA address on the HIE-CM and looks like \u003c14digitabha\u003e@abdm\nKey benefits of creating an ABHA Address are:\nEasy access to health information in a paperless manner Voluntary opt-in and opt-out at anytime Enables authentication for consent driven access to health data along with capabilities to manage and revoke consent Inclusive access to people with smartphones, feature phones, and even no phones using assisted methods Users can create an ABHA address by downloading a PHR mobile application or on a portal provided by the HIE-CM. Use phr.abdm.gov.in to create a new ABHA address\nUsers can create an ABHA addresses in one of two ways:\nUsing self declared information - This requires Name, Year of Birth gender along with a mobile number or email Using an ABHA Number - This requires users to first create an ABHA number with strong KYC Users can start with a self declared ABHA address and later link it to an ABHA number\nNote : While users are allowed to create more than one ABHA address, ABDM encourages every user to have only ONE ABHA address. The process of obtaining an ABHA address is designed to ensure that users don’t accidentally create multiple addresses\nTry it out - Create an ABHA address that you can use on the ABDM sandbox at phrsbx.abdm.gov.in. This will create an ABHA address on the @sbx HIE-CM hosted within the sandbox\nWhat is an ABHA Number? ABHA number is a 14 digit number that is unique (only one per person) issued only after a strong KYC. Every ABHA number is automatically available as an ABHA address like \u003c14digitabhano\u003e@abdm. ABHA is a core building block of the ABDM ecosystem and integrates with several other systems to provide online KYC including Aadhaar, Driving licence and PAN\nYou can obtain an ABHA number by signing up at https://abha.abdm.gov.in\nABHA numbers are extremely important for helping those who use feature phones or do not use a phone to manage their personal health records. ABHA numbers are issued in assisted mode extensively by all Government health programs. Government programs are encouraged to link any health records they create to \u003c14digitabhano\u003e@abdm.\nYou can play around with the sandbox instance of the ABHA building block at https://abhasbx.abdm.gov.in\nWhat is a PHR application? Personal Health Record Applications are software service providers who offer front ends to individuals and enable them to create a ABHA address, discover and link health records from various HIPs, allow users to view their records, offer long term storage of records, upload users health records and share records on the ABDM network. PHR Apps work closely with the HIE-CM and provide a front end for HIE-CM actions like viewing and granting consents. (Note: All PHR Apps are also Health Lockers in earlier version of the HIP/HIU guidelines)\nYou can play around with the sandbox instance of the ABHA PHR app at https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in\nHow does a HIE-CM create a longitudinal Health record ABDM is implemented as a Federated Architecture, where data is kept by the entity that generates the health data (HRP). When a new record is generated by health facility it adds a link called a care context to the user’s PHR address. A PHR address holds the set of links to the health data across multiple facilities (HRPs). The HIE-CM is designed to be data blind, ie it does not know any details of the health records that are linked with the PHR address and the architecture ensures that any exchange of health data does not pass through the HIE-CM.\nThe architecture is also fully aligned with the upcoming Data Protection Bill. The intent is to enable any health facility using a ABDM compliant software to be automatically compliant to the Data protection bill. The HIE-CM as keeps track of all consents provided by the user. Consents are structured as digital consent artifacts that is based on the MietY consent framework\nThe Architecture ensures that there is\nNo central data repository Your PHR Address only holds links Each Health record is held by Health Facility that generated the record Health facilities that become HIPs collect \u0026 save your PHR address during registration HIP / HRPs notify or link new health records with your PHR address HIP / HRPs share a copy of the linked record after verifying user consent Patient can get a copy of the records and view it using a PHR app PHR apps act as repositories that hold a copy of the the health records long term for the user Patients can also upload records by scanning them or from their wearables via PHR apps Only HIPs that are part of the Health Facility Registry can link health records with a PHR address Sharing Health Records With Consent %%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", \"sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram autonumber participant hiu as Health Facility HIU participant hiecm as HIE-CM actor user as User via PHR App participant hrp as Health Facility HRP/HIP actor user Note over hiu : Hospital would like to access medical history with consent Note over hrp : Health Repository Providers holding user data hiu-\u003e\u003ehiecm: Sends consent request to ABHA address(user) hiecm-\u003e\u003euser: Presents consent request to user user-\u003e\u003ehiecm: Users grants consent hiecm-\u003e\u003ehiu: Signed consent from user hiu-\u003e\u003ehiecm: Request data with signed consent hiecm-\u003e\u003ehrp: Request HRP to Share data with HIU after verifying consent hrp-\u003e\u003ehiu: Encrypted health data in FHIR format When any HIU wants to access records linked with a PHR address, it initiates a consent request with the HIE-CM The consent request consists of the purpose for which health records are being sought, why type of records are being sought, from what time period and how long will the HIU like to retain these records HIE-CM forwards the request to the user who can view the request on their PHR app and decide what he actually wants to share when he grants the consent User’s can also decide to revoke the consent anytime after it is granted If the user grants the consent, the HIE-CM shares a signed consent artificat with the the requesting HIU The HIU can now request for data for a PHR address along with the signed consent artificat The HIE-CM forwards the request to all HRPs that are holding the linked data The HRPs verify the consent and push the data to the HIU Data has to be in the specified FHIR format to achieve interoperability Data is encrypted using a method that ensures only the requesting HIU can decrypt the data The ABDM Gateway Gateway is the hub that mediates and connects HIE-CMs, Health Repository Providers and HIUs in the network. Its primary job is to allow for discovery, routing in the network. The gateway does the following:\nConnects and validates the HIE-CMs and health repositories (servicing HIUs and HIPs) to the network. Enables routing of information. Authenticates connected systems within the PHR network (provides a signed authentication token for further communication). The entire PHR framework including the gateway communicates via asynchronous APIs over HTTPs channel. The following figure provides a view of how the Gateway fits in with other components Experience PHR in action using the ABDM sandbox ABDM provides a sandbox environment with core essential services that enable integrators who want to become HIPs/HIUs/HRPs or PHR apps build and test their integration.\nTry out the following\nCreate a PHR address on the sandbox from https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in/ Use EMRSBX to register your PHR address and link it with a new health record Download and login to the Sandbox PHR app with your new PHR address Download ABHA App Provide consent and view the health record you linked via EMRSBX Try adding your COVID vaccination record from CoWIN to your PHR address Other relevant documents National Digital Health Blueprint National Health Stack Electronic Consent Framework ","description":"","tags":null,"title":"The PHR Framework","uri":"/abdm-docs/1-basics/the_phr_framework/index.html"},{"content":"UHI Architecture UHI aims to transform the way digital health services are rendered in India, while ensuring that it is in sync with the other building blocks of ABDM. The functional architecture for UHI is mentioned below. The aim of this architecture is to ensure interoperability for health services and health data. The architecture also depicts how UHI will interact with the other building blocks within ABDM.\nArchitecture Steps 1.A Patient Sign Up/ Login: Patients login using their ABHA number/ Aadhar number / Mobile Number. This is verified by HIE-CM (for login via ABHA number) and UIDAI (for login via Aadhar) through an OTP authentication, post which the login is enabled. In case patients do not have an account, they are asked to sign up using their Aadhar or by providing any other identification documents.\n1.B Health Service Provider Sign Up/ Login: Health Service Providers (HSPs) login using their HPID/ HPR Address (Health Professional Address) on thw HSPA. In case the HSP does not have a Health Professional Address, he/she will be asked to create one using their Registration Number registered with their respective State Council.\n1.C Health Service Provider Details sent to HPR: The details filled by the the Health Service Provider are sent back to the Health Professional Registry.\n2. Patient Search for a Doctor: A patient searches for a doctor on the EUA via defined parameters. The EUA fires Search API to the UHI Gateway to look for the doctors matching the search criteria across the network.\n3. Search Request Sent to all Registered HSPAs: The UHI Gateway broadcasts the search request and the search parameters to all the HSPAs registered on UHI.\n4.A Matching HSPAs Respond: All HSPAs that match the criteria sent by the gateway respond to the request via on_search. HSPAs send back x, y and z. The gateway forwards all responses back to the EUA.\n4.B HSPAs Directly Send Availability to EUAs: While x, y and z is sent via the gateway, as mentioned in the step above, the HSPAs send the availability of a chosen HSP directly to the EUA. This is done via on_search API.\n5. Patient Initiates Booking: The patient choosen any available slot and initiates booking on the EUA. The EUA calls innit API through which it sends the order details.\n6. HSPA Responds to Booking: The HSPA responds via on_innit API and also sends the payment terms for the transaction.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"UHI Architecture Overview","uri":"/abdm-docs/8-uhi/uhi_architecture_overview/index.html"},{"content":"Creation of ABHA Address Understanding ABHA Address What is ABHA Address?\nABHA Address is an easy to remember username that enables a user to access their health records digitally and share their records with various healthcare providers.

The matching logic is as depicted in the flowchart below and also in API specifications: Note: Look for APIs with tag discovery and link %%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% flowchart LR id1 --\u003e|Yes| id5{Return matching Records} id1{Do I have any records for ABHA Address?} --\u003e|No| id2{Do I have any records for Mobile Phone?} id2 --\u003e|No| id4{No matching records found} id2 --\u003e|Yes| id3{Does the gender match?} id3 --\u003e |No| id4 id3 --\u003e|Yes| id6{Is the age within +/- 5 years?} id6 --\u003e |No| id4 id6 --\u003e |Yes| id7{Is the name phonetically similar?} id7 --\u003e |No| id4 id7 --\u003e |Yes| id8{Return matching Records} As response to the discovery request, the HIP must send several masked details, as follows: Patient reference: MHCXX111 - typically the identifier for the patient at the HIP. Display: A description of the patient, comprising of the following information: Name: John Doe Email id: johndoe@example.com Minor: Mother’s name is Jane Doe Refrain from providing any critical information in the display area. For the patient, you need to send one or more care-context detail, as follows: Care context reference: ABXXX222 Display: General diagnosis Provide only a general hint of the patient’s care context here, staying away from private diagnostic details. Here’s an example: TB program: Use your Nikshay program ID PMJAY program: This context is linked with your PMJAY ID - PXXX239 Your last visit was with Dr. Shekhar on 21/03/2020 This is a child’s immunization program Hospitals group patient data in the form of care context. Think of care-context as information about an association of a patient with an HIP for a period of time under which related healthcare activities may occur. Grouping of the care context can be based on the following: Program-based: A patient visiting a hospital can sign up for any program, and belong to multiple programs as well. This kind of grouping is done generally in hospitals which deal with care programs for multiple ailments and specialities such as the general checkup service, cancer program, maternity care and so on. Visit-based: Patient record can be tagged as inpatient, outpatient, or emergency, based on the purpose of the patient’s visit. Episode of Care: Some hospitals are capable of grouping patient records by the specific episode of care Department-based: Patient records can be tagged by department as well, especially in large general hospitals. Verify the patient and link the carecontext as requested by the patient This flow begins once a patient initiates a link request to the HIP to link the care context to the patient’s Consent Manager’s User ID.\nTo enable the linking, the HIP system returns a link reference number along with the authentication type and its associated parameters.\nThe HIP system sends an OTP to the patient’s phone number. Note, the phone number for OTP communication from HIP may be the same as verified by the CM or maybe a different number that the patient has chosen as preferred mode of communication with HIP - meaning it’s up to the HIP to choose the phone number it sends OTP to.\nThe patient, via patient app, submits the OTP received from the HIP system within the stipulated time. If the patient is successfully authenticated by the HIP, the linking is now complete.\nThe following flow diagrams details the flows that take place while linking to a health repository representing an HIP:\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram title Linking (HIP side) PHR App-\u003e\u003eGateway:Link Care Context Gateway-\u003e\u003eRepository:POST/v0.5/links/link/init activate Repository Repository--\u003e\u003eHIP System:Link init Request HIP System--\u003e\u003eRepository: Response Repository-\u003e\u003eGateway:POST/v0.5/links/link/on-init HIP System--\u003e\u003eUser: Send token out-of-band Gateway-\u003e\u003eRepository: POST/v0.5/links/link/confirm Repository--\u003e\u003eHIP System:Link Confirm Request HIP System--\u003e\u003eRepository: Response Repository-\u003e\u003eGateway:POST/v0.5/links/link/on-confirm deactivate Repository API Information Request Response DISCOVERY 1.

The HIU sends these values to HDCM, along with the data request via a digitally-signed API call. HDCM forwards the request to the HIP, again via a digitally-signed API call. HIP checks whether the consent artefact is valid, and whether the data being requested is in keeping with the terms of the artefact. If the artefact is valid, the HIP does the following: Generates a fresh ECDH public-private key pair in the same group as specified by the HIU ((dhsk(P), dhpk(P)) Generates a 32-byte random value rand(P) aka nonce. Computes a ECDH shared key dhk(U,P) using dhpk(U) and dhsk(P) Computes a 256-bit session key sk(U,P) using dhpk(U) and dhsk(P), which is used to encrypt the data sent from HIP to HIU. HIP sends the public key dhpk(P), the nonce rand(P) and the encrypted data to the HIU. Data decryption for HIU The following process is applied to decrypt the data that the HIU receives:\nHIU receives the encrypted data along with keymaterial containing dhpk(p), nonce. HIU queries through stored data and gets the keymaterial which it created when initiating the data flow request, as follows: It computes a ECDH shared key dhk(U,P) using dhpk(P) and dhsk(U). It then computes a 256-bit session key sk(U,P) using dhpk(P) and dhsk(U), which is used to decrypt the data sent from HIP to HIU. Note: In order to generate the shared secret key, dhpk(P) should be used, minus headers. Following the big endian (network byte order) keeps the used to derive the shared secret consistent. Also as the cryptography deals with large numbers, it’s recommended that no data is converted to binary format until its first converted to big integer.\nHere is a sample set of libraries that you can use:\nOpenssl Bouncy castle (ensure the X dhpk is a big integer) NaCl Libgcrypt PyNaCls TweetNaCl While most libraries allow exporting of public keys, these keys are compressed and encoded for the most part. It is best to use the libraries to extract the uncompressed form of the public key, that will start with a hex 04. The 32 bytes after the 04 is the X.\nThe ECDH mechanism ensures that the shared key dh(U,P) can also be computed at the other end by the HIU using the values dhpk(P) (HIP’s ECDH public key) and dhsk(U) (HIU’s ECDH private key). For this reason, the HIP must ensure that the encrypted data is sent along with dhpk(P) and rand(P).\nThe following data flow diagram represents the information encryption and decryption process between the HIU and the HIP:\nSteps to encrypt data The following steps are involved in data encryption, on both sides:\nThe session key is derived from the shared secret key dh(U, P) as follows:\nXOR the nonce (HIP and HIU) Take the first 20 bytes as the salt for HKDF Derive the key using HKDF(shared key, salt) Now encrypt the data using AES GCM as follows:\nXOR the nonce Take the last 12 bytes as the IV for GCM Encrypt the data Data encryption summary: Choice of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman parameters\nThe key exchange will be performed over Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) groups. We will adhere to a single ECC curve, namely Curve25519, in all encryption operations. Curve25519 is used in ECDH implementations in various protocols like SSH and WhatsApp.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"New Prog.

The HIU must remove any copy of the users’ data when the consent is revoked.\nAll HIPs who are holding any data associated with this consent are notified. They must save a copy of the consent artefact in their system. Data can be shared against this consent any number of times till the consent expires / is revoked by the user. Making a consent request (as HIU) An HIU can create a request to obtain a patient’s consent to access her health information, as follows:\nAs an HIU, you will need to log in to sandbox’s reference doctor’s interface with login credentials (this will be sent to you via email). If you don’t have your login credentials, Send a Request to Integrate Your Test Environment to NHA. NHA will respond along with your login credentials. After logging in, you can create the consent request by providing the following details: User’s consent manager ID Purpose of your consent request Details of who is requesting the health information The time period for which you require the patient’s health documents. This information will enable your HIP to share the patient’s health documents relevant to the required time period. Provide a list of the health information types for which you’re requesting, such as clinical notes, examination data and so forth. Your consent request as HIU comes with a consent expiry time, after which you will not be able to access the patient’s data. Receiving a consent artefact (as HIP) The HIP receives the consent artefact after patients grants a request. The consent artefact lets the HIP know what data needs to be shared, as detailed below:\nPatient’s consent manager ID Purpose of data access consent Details of who is requesting the health information and of whom Health information types; the HIP needs to maintain details of what has been requested and what has been sent, as detailed in the following table: What is requested? What needs to be sent? Prescription Medicaton that the doctor advised Diagnostic Report Diagnostic Report that was created following a test/procedure OP Consultation Out Patient Consultation Document which may include complaints, prescription, observations, follow ups, appointments, test reports etc Discharge Summary Discharge Summary document which may include conditions, medications, observations, procedure done, discharge note, treatment plan etc Immunization Record Immunization records with any additional documents such as vaccine certificate, the next immunization recommendations, etc. Record artifact Unstructured historical health records as a single of multiple Health Record Documents generally uploaded by the patients through the Health Locker and can be shared across the health ecosystem. Wellness Record Regular wellness information of patients typically through the Patient Health Record (ABHA) application covering clinical information such as vitals, physical examination, general wellness, women wellness, etc. Note: For detailed information on what information can be sent for a requested HI Type, please refer to the Data Format Specifications\nThe consent request is time-bound; after time is elapsed the HIU cannot view the data once the user has granted and HIP should check this date before sending any data.

A data push URL, which is a callback URL that indicates where the information can be pushed by the HIP’s health repository. This URL can be different from the HIU’s access URL, provided at the time of registration with the gateway. The HIU can specify a different URL for the data flow, in order to keep its identity secret to the extent possible. Several parameters such as the date-time range for the requested and a set of encryption parameters for the HIP repository to encrypt the information. The Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman based encryption standard is used for encrypting health information. Upon receipt of the data-request, CM assigns a transaction ID (txn-id) for the entire data flow and communicates this Id to the health repositories of the HIU and the HIP.\nThe HIU’s health repository relays all this information to the CM through the gateway.From the CM, the information is relayed to the respective HIP’s health repository (via the gateway).\nSecond Stage Once the HIP repository receives the information, it first validates the information request, as follows:\nThe HIP finds out if the consent ID corresponds to an expired, paused or revoked artefact.\nIt then checks if the request for which the date-time range corresponds to the range for which the consent artefact allows information access. It also ensures that the encryption parameters are correctly defined.\nOnce the above checks are made and validated, the HIP health repository encrypts the requested health records and forwards it along with the transaction ID to the HIU’s data push URL, after signing the encrypted data with its long-term private key.\nThird Stage Finally, the CM receives notifications from both the HIP and the HIU. The HIP’s health repository notifies the CM that the requested information was transmitted to the HIU. The HIU’s health repository sends a notification that the requested information was successfully received, or that the request failed.\nAPI Sequence All above 3 stages that pertains to HIU are shown in the following diagram:\nAPI Information Request Response 1.

Health information data request Request for Health information against a consent id. CM would generate a transactionId against each consent and pass it as trnasaction context / correlation id to the HIP and also return the same to HIU via /on-request.\nURL: https://dev.ndhm.gov.in/gateway/v0.5/health-information/cm/request\nRequest: POST\nParameters:\nAuthorization string (header) : Bearer your-access-token-from-gateway-session Access token which was issued after successful login with gateway auth server\nX-CM-ID string (header) : sbx (or) abdm Suffix-of-the-consent-manager\nBody:\n{ \"requestId\": \"a1s2c932-2f70-3ds3-a3b5-2sfd46b12a18d\", \"timestamp\": \"2022-06-22T09:01:16.382Z\", \"hiRequest\": { \"consent\": { \"id\": \"string\" }, \"dateRange\": { \"from\": \"2022-06-22T09:01:16.382Z\", \"to\": \"2022-06-22T09:01:16.382Z\" }, \"dataPushUrl\": \"string\", \"keyMaterial\": { \"cryptoAlg\": \"ECDH\", \"curve\": \"Curve25519\", \"dhPublicKey\": { \"expiry\": \"2022-06-22T09:01:16.382Z\", \"parameters\": \"Curve25519/32byte random key\", \"keyValue\": \"string\" }, \"nonce\": \"3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\" } } } Response:\n202 Accepted\n3. Response for Health information data request Callback API for acknowledgement of Health information request of HIU. CM calls this API when it has validated the Health Information request given the consent id. Either the hiRequest or error would need to be specified. If the health info request was valid, then the hiRequest.transactionId specifies the transaction context against which HIP would send over the data. Possible cases of errors are\nInvalid consent artefact id Consent has expired Date ranges are invalid URL: {HIU CALLBACK URL}/v0.5/health-information/cm/on-request\nRequest: POST\nParameters:\nAuthorization string (header) : Bearer your-access-token-from-gateway-session Access token which was issued after successful login with gateway auth server\nX-HIU-ID string (header) : your-HIU-ID Identifier of the health information user to which the request was intended\nBody:\n{ \"requestId\": \"a1s2c932-2f70-3ds3-a3b5-2sfd46b12a18d\", \"timestamp\": \"2022-06-22T09:04:29.973Z\", \"hiRequest\": { \"transactionId\": \"a1s2c932-2f70-3ds3-a3b5-2sfd46b12a18d\", \"sessionStatus\": \"REQUESTED\" }, \"error\": { \"code\": 1000, \"message\": \"string\" }, \"resp\": { \"requestId\": \"3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\" } } Response:\n202 Accepted\n4. Health information transfer API This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU. Entry elements maybe content or link, although for version 1, entry content is preferred. Entry content (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is “application/fhir+json” checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption Please refer to the ABDM Sandbox documentation for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content\nNote: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as dataPushUrl in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway.\nURL: {Data_push_url}/v0.5/health-information/transfer\nRequest: POST\nParameters:\nAuthorization string (header) : Bearer your-access-token-from-gateway-session Access token which was issued after successful login with gateway auth server\nBody:\n{ \"pageNumber\": 0, \"pageCount\": 0, \"transactionId\": \"3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\", \"entries\": [ { \"content\": \"Encrypted content of data packaged in FHIR bundle\", \"media\": \"application/fhir+json\", \"checksum\": \"string\", \"careContextReference\": \"RVH1008\" }, { \"link\": \"https://data-from.net/sa2321afaf12e13\", \"media\": \"application/fhir+json\", \"checksum\": \"string\", \"careContextReference\": \"NCC1701\" } ], \"keyMaterial\": { \"cryptoAlg\": \"ECDH\", \"curve\": \"Curve25519\", \"dhPublicKey\": { \"expiry\": \"2022-06-22T09:07:16.948Z\", \"parameters\": \"Curve25519/32byte random key\", \"keyValue\": \"string\" }, \"nonce\": \"3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6\" } } Response:\n202 Accepted\n5.

A data push URL, which is a callback URL that indicators where the information can be pushed by the HIP’s health repository. This URL can be different from the HIU’s access URL, provided at the time of registration with the gateway. The HIU can specify a different URL for the data flow, in order to keep its identity secret to the extent possible. Several parameters such as the date-time range for the requested and a set of encryption parameters for the HIP repository to encrypt the information. The Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman based encryption standard is used for encrypting health information. The HIU’s health repository relays all this information to the CM through the gateway. From the CM, the information is relayed to the HIP’s health repository (via the gateway).\nSecond Stage\nOnce the HIP repository receives the information, it first validates the information request, as follows:\nThe HIP finds out if the consent ID corresponds to an expired, paused or revoked artefact. It then checks if the request’s date-time range will correspond to the range for which the consent artefact allows information access. It also ensures that the encryption parameters are correctly defined. Once the above checks are made and validated, the HIP health repository encrypts the requested health records and forwards it along with the transaction ID to the HIU’s data push URL, after signing the encrypted data with its long-term private key. Third Stage\nFinally, the CM receives notifications from both the HIP and the HIU. The HIP’s health repository notifies the CM that the requested information was transmitted to the HIU. The HIU’s health repository sends a notification that the requested information was successfully received, or that the request failed.\nAll above 3 stages that pertains to HIP are shown in the following diagram:\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", \"sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram title Request for Health Records HIE-CM-\u003e\u003eHIP/HRP:POST/v0.5/health-information/hip/request activate HIP/HRP HIP/HRP--\u003e\u003eHIP/HRP System:notification HIP/HRP-\u003e\u003eHIE-CM:POST/v0.5/health-information/hip/on-request When HIP gets the request for data transfer, it first validates the consent:\nConsent ID is valid Consent has not expired Data requested is within the consent granted range Only data types that are granted in the consent, are shared API Information Request Response 1.

ABDM Client IDs \u0026 Call Back URLs Every organization that registers with ABDM is issued one or more Client IDs Each Client ID should be used by the organization to register ONE INSTANCE of their ABDM compiliant software One Client ID can be used to register only ONE callback URL. Each instance of the software can hold health records for one or more health facilities Each Health Facility is given an ID from the Health Facility Registry. The Facility ID \u0026 Client ID need to be registered in the ABDM Gateway registry This Facility id must be passed in X-HIP-ID Header in ABDM apis The HIE-CM APIs are designed to be asyncronous. When you call an API on the gateway, if the request is accepted you will merely get a HTTP 200 response acknowledging that the request has been recorded.\nOnce the response is available, the gateway will invoke the callback URL registered for the Client ID. All integrators must register a call back URL for their Client ID\nThe Sequence diagram below provides an example of the asyncronous nature of the ABDM APIs.\n%%{init:{\"fontSize\": \"1.0rem\", \"sequence\":{\"showSequenceNumbers\":true}}}%% sequenceDiagram autonumber participant client as HRP participant gateway as ABDM Gateway Note over client : Each instance of HRP has a client Id from ABDM Note over client : Each instance registers a callback Url client-\u003e\u003egateway: /v0.5/users/auth/fetch-modes gateway-\u003e\u003eclient: Response: 200 (as acknowledgment) Note right of client : asynchronous calls gateway-\u003e\u003eclient: /v0.5/users/auth/on-fetch-modes client-\u003e\u003egateway: Response: 200 (as acknowledgment) Registering your callback URL The callback URL is the url for your site where your application recieves APIs calls from the ABDM gateway. After obtaining the client ID and the secret, use the gateway sessions api to get the accessToken. Use the below api, to register the callback url. Pass the Gateway Session Token in the “Authorization:” header and the callback url in “url:”.\ncurl --location --request PATCH 'https://dev.abdm.gov.in/devservice/v1/bridges' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token-from-gateway-session' --data-raw '{ \"url\": \"https://my-emr-site.in\" } Disclaimer This API is only available in in sandbox. This is configured via a different API / UI in production\nAfter registering the callback url, if we fire any API which has a callback, ABDM will post the response of the fired API to that callback url. You can use the /v1/bridge/getServices API to check what is configured for your client ID including the callback URL.\nLinking the HIPs / HIUs ID for a Client ID The HIP code used by ABDM is the same as the health facility registry ID.\nIn the Sandbox you can simply declare a HIP/HIU ID without it being part of the health facility registry. You can use it to link one HIP / HIU ID with your Client ID with no validations.\nAll HIUs including PHR apps also need to register a HIU code.\nCheck your configuration For detailed APIs related to registration with the ABDM gateway\nhttps://sandbox.abdm.gov.in/swagger/ndhm-devservice.yaml\nABDM HTTP Headers A single ABDM Client (also called a Bridge) can support multiple HIPs / HIUs on the same registered URL. In order to clearly identify which HIP / HIU this message was intented to be sent, the Gateway adds the following headers as part its API calls\nThe X-HIP-ID Header – Contains the health facility registry code that is linked to the Client ID The X-HIU-ID Header – Contains the health information user code that is linked to this Client ID The ABDM architecture is designed to support multiple HIE-CMs. Whenever you call any Gateway API you must include a header that tells the gateway which HIE-CM must this request be sent to\nX-CM-ID – Pass ‘sbx’ if you are in the sandbox, Pass ‘abdm’ if you are in production. You must get this from HIE-CM domain name suffixed after the @ symbol in a PHR address. Use Webhook to learn APIs We recommend using a combination of Postman \u0026 webhook to quickly understand ABDM APIs. Use your postman collection and ensure your async callbacks are working in sandbox\nGo to https://webhook.site Copy your unique URL (which would be your callback url) shown on the page Register it with ABDM Gateway. Ensure you get a Response: 200 Link a HIP / HIU ID of your choice to your client id. Ensure you get a Response: 200 Create a Sandbox ABHA address at https://phrsbx.abdm.gov.in Call an async Gateway API like /v0.5/users/auth/fetch-modes with the @sbx ABHA address Verify you get a callback (like /v0.5/users/auth/on-fetch-modes) at your webhook site.

Once that is validated, the HIP/HRP will encrypt the data with the Public Key of the HIU The ecnrypted data is then shared with HIU. HIUs will have to decrypt data using their Private key.
