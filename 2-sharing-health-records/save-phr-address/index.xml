      <description>Overview of the functionality  Patient must have a PHR app and have a valid PHR address Hospital must generate a HIP QR code and display it at the registration counter Patient scans the QR code from his phone camera or his PHR app If scanned from phone camera &amp;ndash; The list of installed PHR apps is shown on the phone. The user can select any of the apps If scanned from within the PHR app, the app will call the share-profile API on the HIE-CM The HIE-CM will verify this is a registered healthcare provider and identify the HRP linked to this HIP in the ABDM registry The Gateway will call the share-profile api on the callback URL registered for this HRP The HRP software must create a screen to display all the scanned profiles for a (counter) code The operator (at a counter) should be able to select a shared profile and perform a fast user registration Remember to correctly handle this for both new and returning patients</description>
