Upon receipt of such a request from Gateway, CM acknowledges and sends back a consent request ID to the HIU via the gateway. The CM then notifies the patient that an HIU has made a consent request.

The functional architecture for UHI is mentioned below. The aim of this architecture is to ensure interoperability for health services and health data. The architecture also depicts how UHI will interact with the other building blocks within ABDM.
